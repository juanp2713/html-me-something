        <h2>My Profeesional Career</h2>

        <div>
            <p>My IT Professional career began in 2017, when I was hired on as a Service Desk Analyst for Build A Bear Workshop.
            I started off just taking calls and working tickets in a system we call 'Heat', where we would find incidents or Service Requests
            submitted by employees at our stores, warehouses, European and North American corporate offices. This is what we 
            call a Front Line Analyst.
            </p>

            <p>After 8 months, I moved to a secondary role as a Service Desk Analyst called Support. This role takes a step away
            from just taking calls and working tickets and handles more Desktop Support related issues. I also work extensivley
            in Active Directory, Exchange and Office 365, imaging PCs and Macs, as well as creating scripts using powershell.
            </p>

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>
                I plan to move on from a Service Desk role and into a Software Developer or Architecture role.
                Later down the line, I would love to be a Database Administrator.
